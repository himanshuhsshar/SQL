+----+-----------+
| 3  | 1         |
| 11 | 2         |
| 90 | 3         |
+----+-----------+
Output: 
+-----------+----------+
| unique_id | name     |

From sale_id = 2, we can conclude that Nokia was sold for 5000 in the year 2009.
From sale_id = 7, we can conclude that Apple was sold for 9000 in the year 2011.

Solution :

select pd.product_name, sl.year, sl.price from Sales sl inner join product pd on sl.product_id=pd.product_id;

| 96          | 1              |
+-------------+----------------+
Explanation: 
Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.
Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.
Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during 
one visit they made 3 transactions.
Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also, user 54 
visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select vst.customer_id, count(vst.customer_id) as count_no_trans from visits vst left join transactions
tx on vst.visit_id = tx.visit_id where tx.visit_id is null group by vst.customer_id;
