10. Average Time of Process per Machine

Table: Activity

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| machine_id     | int     |
| process_id     | int     |
| activity_type  | enum    |
| timestamp      | float   |
+----------------+---------+
The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
machine_id is the ID of a machine.
process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').
timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the 
given timestamp.
The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.
It is guaranteed that each (machine_id, process_id) pair has a 'start' and 'end' timestamp.
 

There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find 
the average time each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by 
the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded 
to 3 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Activity table:
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |
| 0          | 0          | end           | 1.520     |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.140     |
| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.120     |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.550     |
| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.550     |
| 1          | 1          | start         | 0.430     |
| 1          | 1          | end           | 1.420     |
| 2          | 0          | start         | 4.100     |
| 2          | 0          | end           | 4.512     |
| 2          | 1          | start         | 2.500     |
| 2          | 1          | end           | 5.000     |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
Output: 
+------------+-----------------+
| machine_id | processing_time |
+------------+-----------------+
| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |
+------------+-----------------+
Explanation: 
There are 3 machines running 2 processes each.
Machine 0's average time is ((1.520 - 0.712) + (4.120 - 3.140)) / 2 = 0.894
Machine 1's average time is ((1.550 - 0.550) + (1.420 - 0.430)) / 2 = 0.995
Machine 2's average time is ((4.512 - 4.100) + (5.000 - 2.500)) / 2 = 1.456



Solution :

Approach
To solve this problem, 1st we need to join the same table, so we will have starting time and ending time 
in the same line:

select a1.machine_id, a1.timestamp, a2.timestamp
from Activity a1
join Activity a2
on a1.process_id=a2.process_id
and a1.machine_id=a2.machine_id
and a1.timestamp<a2.timestamp;

| machine_id | timestamp | timestamp |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| 0          | 0.712     | 1.52      |
| 0          | 3.14      | 4.12      |
| 1          | 0.55      | 1.55      |
| 1          | 0.43      | 1.42      |
| 2          | 4.1       | 4.512     |
| 2          | 2.5       | 5         |
now we can calculate the difference between timestamps, group the values by machine_id and round average value 
of differences

select a1.machine_id
, ROUND(AVG(a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp),3) as processing_time
from Activity a1
join Activity a2
on a1.process_id=a2.process_id
and a1.machine_id=a2.machine_id
and a1.timestamp<a2.timestamp
group by a1.machine_id;

| machine_id | processing_time |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |

+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
Explanation: 
The result table should contain all students and all subjects.
Alice attended the Math exam 3 times, the Physics exam 2 times, and the Programming exam 1 time.
Bob attended the Math exam 1 time, the Programming exam 1 time, and did not attend the Physics exam.
Alex did not attend any exams.
John attended the Math exam 1 time, the Physics exam 1 time, and the Programming exam 1 time.


Solution:
Step by Step
First, let's group subjects by student.

SELECT
    student_id
    ,student_name
    ,subject_name
Our goal is to list the subjects for each student.

Like this:

| student_id | student_name | subject_name |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1          | Alice        | Programming  |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      |
| 1          | Alice        | Math         |
| 2          | Bob          | Programming  |
| 2          | Bob          | Physics      |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         |
We're going to use a CROSS JOIN (Cartesian product)

which is like making every possible pair of rows from two tables.


SELECT
    student_id
    ,student_name
    ,subject_name
FROM Students 
CROSS JOIN Subjects


Now we need to add the exam results.

Time to LEFT JOIN so we can show a '0' for subjects students didn't take, it will be clear later.


LEFT JOIN Examinations E
connect this table to the others

LEFT JOIN Examinations E
    ON E.student_id = S.student_id
    AND E.subject_name = SU.subject_name
And ordered the results

ORDER BY S.student_id, S.student_name, SU.subject_name
SELECT
    s.student_id
    ,s.student_name
    ,SU.subject_name
FROM Students S
CROSS JOIN Subjects SU
LEFT JOIN Examinations E
    ON E.student_id = S.student_id
    AND E.subject_name = SU.subject_name
ORDER BY S.student_id, S.student_name, SU.subject_name


Each attempt at Alice's exam is displayed one after another.

And we want to count them.


We will use Count()

What exactly are we counting? We could count either e.subject_id or e.student_id, but the way we GROUP the data will
be crucial.

We want to count the attempts of a given person, so now we need to assign the result to people and then to their subjects

We want to find out how many times Alice has taken an exam in a SPECIFIC subject

COUNT(e.subject_id) AS attended_exams
and we need to GROUP the results

GROUP BY S.student_id, S.student_name, Su.subject_name
final code:

SELECT
    S.student_id
    ,S.student_name
    ,Su.subject_name
    ,COUNT(E.student_id) attended_exams
FROM Students S
CROSS JOIN Subjects Su
LEFT JOIN Examinations E
    ON S.student_id = E.student_id
    AND Su.subject_name = E.subject_name
GROUP BY S.student_id, S.student_name, Su.subject_name
ORDER BY S.student_id, S.student_name, Su.subject_name
Output:

| student_id | student_name | subject_name | attended_exams |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 3              |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      | 2              |
| 1          | Alice        | Programming  | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Physics      | 0              |
| 2          | Bob          | Programming  | 1              |

| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
No employee will be the manager of themself.
 

Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| id  | name  | department | managerId |

| 101 | John  | A          | null      |
| 102 | Dan   | A          | 101       |
| 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 106 | Ron   | B          | 101       |
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
Output: 
+------+
| name |
+------+
| John |
+------+


Solution :

SELECT E1.name
FROM Employee E1
JOIN (
    SELECT managerId, COUNT(*) AS directReports
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY managerId
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
) E2 ON E1.id = E2.managerId;


SELECT e.name
FROM Employee AS e 
INNER JOIN Employee AS m ON e.id=m.managerId 
GROUP BY m.managerId 
HAVING COUNT(m.managerId) >= 5


SELECT name 
FROM Employee 
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT managerId 
    FROM Employee 
    GROUP BY managerId 
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5)



SELECT a.name 
FROM Employee a 
JOIN Employee b ON a.id = b.managerId 
GROUP BY b.managerId 
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5




SELECT e1.name
FROM employee e1
LEFT JOIN employee e2 ON e1.id=e2.managerId
GROUP BY e1.id
HAVING COUNT(e2.name) >= 5;

14. Not Boring Movies

Table: Cinema

+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| id             | int      |
| movie          | varchar  |
| description    | varchar  |
| rating         | float    |
+----------------+----------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
rating is a 2 decimal places float in the range [0, 10]
 

Write a solution to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".

Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Cinema table:
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
| 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
| 3  | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
| 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
Output: 
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
Explanation: 
We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not include it in 
the answer.


Solution :

select * from cinema where id%2 != 0 and description!="boring" ORDER BY rating DESC;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15. Confirmation Rate
Table: Signups

+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
+----------------+----------+
user_id is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row contains information about the signup time for the user with ID user_id.
 

Table: Confirmations

+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
| action         | ENUM     |
+----------------+----------+
(user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
user_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Signups table.
action is an ENUM (category) of the type ('confirmed', 'timeout')
Each row of this table indicates that the user with ID user_id requested a confirmation message at time_stamp and 
that confirmation message was either confirmed ('confirmed') or expired without confirming ('timeout').
 

The confirmation rate of a user is the number of 'confirmed' messages divided by the total number of requested 
confirmation messages. The confirmation rate of a user that did not request any confirmation messages is 0. 
Round the confirmation rate to two decimal places.

Write a solution to find the confirmation rate of each user.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Signups table:
+---------+---------------------+
| user_id | time_stamp          |
+---------+---------------------+
| 3       | 2020-03-21 10:16:13 |
| 7       | 2020-01-04 13:57:59 |
| 2       | 2020-07-29 23:09:44 |
| 6       | 2020-12-09 10:39:37 |
+---------+---------------------+
Confirmations table:
+---------+---------------------+-----------+
| user_id | time_stamp          | action    |
+---------+---------------------+-----------+
| 3       | 2021-01-06 03:30:46 | timeout   |
| 3       | 2021-07-14 14:00:00 | timeout   |
| 7       | 2021-06-12 11:57:29 | confirmed |
| 7       | 2021-06-13 12:58:28 | confirmed |
| 7       | 2021-06-14 13:59:27 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-01-22 00:00:00 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-02-28 23:59:59 | timeout   |
+---------+---------------------+-----------+
Output: 
+---------+-------------------+
| user_id | confirmation_rate |
+---------+-------------------+
| 6       | 0.00              |
| 3       | 0.00              |
| 7       | 1.00              |
| 2       | 0.50              |
+---------+-------------------+
Explanation: 
User 6 did not request any confirmation messages. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 3 made 2 requests and both timed out. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 7 made 3 requests and all were confirmed. The confirmation rate is 1.
User 2 made 2 requests where one was confirmed and the other timed out. The confirmation rate is 1 / 2 = 0.5.

Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select s.user_id, round(avg(if(c.action="confirmed",1,0)),2) as confirmation_rate
from Signups as s left join Confirmations as c on s.user_id= c.user_id group by user_id;


Approach
left join Signups table with Confirmations table, group by user_id.
we have to display user_id and confirmation_rate :
user_id will be simply displayed.
to display confirmation_rate , we need to find average using aggregation function avg(), here using if clause we 
specified that if action is confirmed we count it as 1 and else if null or timeout we will count it as 0.

16. Average Selling Price
Table: Prices

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| start_date    | date    |
| end_date      | date    |
| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods 
for the same product_id.
 

Table: UnitsSold

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| purchase_date | date    |
| units         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
This table may contain duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold. 
 

Write a solution to find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places. If a product does not have any sold units, its average selling price is assumed to be 0.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Prices table:
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price  |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
| 1          | 2019-02-17 | 2019-02-28 | 5      |
| 1          | 2019-03-01 | 2019-03-22 | 20     |
| 2          | 2019-02-01 | 2019-02-20 | 15     |
| 2          | 2019-02-21 | 2019-03-31 | 30     |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
UnitsSold table:
+------------+---------------+-------+
| product_id | purchase_date | units |
+------------+---------------+-------+
| 1          | 2019-02-25    | 100   |
| 1          | 2019-03-01    | 15    |
| 2          | 2019-02-10    | 200   |
| 2          | 2019-03-22    | 30    |
+------------+---------------+-------+
Output: 
+------------+---------------+
| product_id | average_price |
+------------+---------------+
| 1          | 6.96          |
| 2          | 16.96         |
+------------+---------------+
Explanation: 
Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.
Average selling price for product 1 = ((100 * 5) + (15 * 20)) / 115 = 6.96
Average selling price for product 2 = ((200 * 15) + (30 * 30)) / 230 = 16.96


Solution:


SELECT p.product_id,IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(u.units * p.price) / SUM(u.units), 2), 0) AS average_price
FROM Prices p
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u
ON p.product_id = u.product_id 
AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id;


Explanantion:

Explanation
Step 1: Joining Prices with UnitsSold (JOIN)

We join the Prices table with the UnitsSold table using product_id where the purchase_date falls 
within the start_date and end_date.
This ensures each unit sold is matched with the correct price.

Step 2: Calculating the Total Price and Units Sold
We compute the total selling price as SUM(units * price).
We compute the total number of units sold as SUM(units).

Step 3: Computing the Average Selling Price
We divide the total selling price by total units sold using AVG(price).
If a product has no sales, we return 0 using IFNULL.

Step 4: Rounding
The result is rounded to two decimal places using ROUND().
