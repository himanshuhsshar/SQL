Classes More Than 5 Students

Table: Courses

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| student     | varchar |
| class       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
(student, class) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of a student and the class in which they are enrolled.
 

Write a solution to find all the classes that have at least five students.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Courses table:
+---------+----------+
| student | class    |
+---------+----------+
| A       | Math     |
| B       | English  |
| C       | Math     |
| D       | Biology  |
| E       | Math     |
| F       | Computer |
| G       | Math     |
| H       | Math     |
| I       | Math     |
+---------+----------+
Output: 
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
Explanation: 
- Math has 6 students, so we include it.
- English has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Biology has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Computer has 1 student, so we do not include it.


Solution:

SELECT class
FROM courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5;


✅ What this query does:
SELECT class: We're interested in the class column.

FROM courses: We're pulling data from the courses table.

GROUP BY class: We group rows that have the same value in the class column — this creates one 
row per unique class.

HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5: We filter these groups to only return classes that appear 5 or more times in the table.

🔸 HAVING is like WHERE, but it's used after grouping.

📘 Example:
Sample courses Table:
id	class
1	Math
2	Physics
3	Math
4	Math
5	Biology
6	Math
7	Physics
8	Math
9	Biology
10	Physics
11	Physics
12	Physics
13	Chemistry

Step 1: Group by class
Let’s count how many times each class appears:

class	count(*)
Math	5
Physics	5
Biology	2
Chemistry	1

Step 2: Apply HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
This filters out any groups with less than 5 rows:

class
Math
Physics

✅ Final Result:
The query will return:


Math
Physics
These are the classes that have 5 or more students/records in the courses table.

🔁 Summary of Key SQL Concepts:
Clause	Purpose
GROUP BY	Combines rows with same class value
COUNT(*)	Counts how many rows in each group
HAVING	Filters groups (used after GROUP BY)
